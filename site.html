<p>I spend my time thinking about the design of elegant systems and have strong opinions about privacy in the digital age.</p>
<p>I've worked with <a href="https://www.starleaf.com/">StarLeaf</a>, <a href="https://atos.net/en/">Atos</a>, <a href="https://deliveroo.co.uk/">Deliveroo</a>, as a Python &amp; Arduino tutor and on a number of cool personal projects;</p>
<h1 id="peer-to-peer-poker-dissertation">Peer to Peer Poker Dissertation</h1>
<p>Abstract: In this project, we explore the concept of playing Texas Hold 'em Poker without a trusted authority by using a decentralised Peer to Peer network model. We consider the applications of such a protocol in fighting internet censorship while avoiding funding corrupt casinos, and the resultant challenges involving the cryptographic protocol, the lack of trust in such a decentralised system and in the implementation of poker. The final product is a toolkit for peer to peer card games, with an implementation of Texas Hold 'em poker to demonstrate itâ€™s functionality. <a href="./psyrc3-g53ids-no-appendix.pdf">PDF link</a></p>

<h1 id="torocam">toroCam</h1>
<p>ToroCam is a camera control system, which gives you unparallelled control over your SLR though an open source app and a small, Arduino compatible board. Unlike competing solutions, your phone is never tethered to the camera when using toroCam as a high performance dedicated board connects to the camera directly and the phone is only responsible for sending instructions on which triggers the board should use - allowing the system to react in microseconds to sensor values, far quicker than any dedicated mobile based solution which allows us to take precisely timed photos such as the following:</p>

<p>The custom made toroCam boards look like this:</p>

<h1 id="choco-quickstart">Choco Quickstart</h1>
<p>Choco Quickstart is a nifty little tool that I wrote to give windows users a quick quickstart package of software for new installs using the Chocolatey package manager. <img src="./quickstart.png" /></p>
<p>Unlike the competition, choco quickstart makes use of a package manager to make updates to software easy to manage instead of just bundling all the installers into one installer program.</p>

<p>Chive is a web based music streaming website that pulls data about Albums, Artists, Genres and related music from the Last.fm and MusicBrainz APIs, presenting a music-first frontend that looks up the relevant youtube videos for each song which is played in the background. <img src="./chiveui.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
